> ####记美国之行

这是本人小白第一次来到美帝，美国之旅收获不小；常言道，读万卷书不如行万里路，行万里路不如阅人无数。除了知识技能的学习之外，增长见识、体味人生也是一种学习和进步，因此这趟来到美国想见识见识国外的世界是怎样的，以便为自己选择以后的路做准备。

1.美国更注重人权，服务业尤其注重服务的质量(在中国飞机延误就延误了，没有任何赔偿方法；而美国航空公司会对你的飞机延误造成的损失进行赔偿，飞机延误后对饭钱、酒店钱、的士钱都给予了安排和报销)

2.美国人非常热情好客，在酒店楼下吧台刚坐下就有两个外国小姐姐搭讪，非常热情的和你聊天，因为有些地区的移民数量巨大，所以对不同人种的接受程度比较高，尤其是年轻人，对不同肤色的歧视程度相对较低。

3.美国人生活幸福指数高，很少有人为了生活和前途疲于奔命，社会整体节奏相对较慢，大家每天过的都非常真诚、快乐而洒脱。

4.相对于居住于城市，美国人更喜欢在郊区居住，不仅环境优美人员稀少，而且交通便利，几乎每家每户都有车，出行也都是开车，很少见到人步行出门。

5.由于常开车少步行、爱吃垃圾食品、以丰满为美等观点，造成了美国很大一部分居民的身材不敢让人恭维，尤其是一些上了年纪的女性，这和电影里见到的男性八块腹肌、女性人鱼马甲完全不同。

6.可能是由于美国互联网环境不如国内发达的缘故，美国没有中国一般的低头族，几乎很少见到低头玩手机的人，感觉美国人更注重享受生活，而不是像某些人一样沉浸在虚拟世界中无法自拔

7.美国的资源是国内无法比拟的，所以绝大多数美国人都在毫无节制的浪费国家资源，吃饭浪费一大堆，室内空调从来没关过，粮食有点不太好了就直接扔掉，绝对不会因为省钱而节约没必要的花销。

8.过去只听说过中国式过马路，现在见到了美国人过马路的方式才发现是多么直接：美国规定是车让人的，红绿灯也是给车看的，人过马路根本没有必要看红绿灯。相比较之下，论交通规则对行人的友好程度：美国>中国>香港

This is the first time that such a Xiaobai like me came to the US .The feeling to the United States is not small. As the saying goes, it is better to read thousands of miles than to read thousands of books just as It is better to read thousands of miles. In addition to the study of knowledge and skills, increasing knowledge and understanding of life is also a kind of learning and progress. Therefore, I came to the United States to see what the world of foreign countries is, in order to prepare for the future.

1. The United States pays more attention to human rights, and the service industry pays special attention to the quality of services (the delay in China's aircraft is delayed, there is no compensation method; and American Airlines will compensate for the loss caused by your aircraft delay, and the money will be delayed after the flight delay.) , hotel money, taxi money are given arrangements and reimbursement)

2. The Americans are very hospitable. There are two foreign ladies and sisters sitting downstairs in the hotel. They are very enthusiastic to chat with you. Because the number of immigrants in some areas is huge, the acceptance of different ethnic groups is relatively high. Especially young people, the degree of discrimination against different skin colors is relatively low.

3. Americans have a high happiness index. Few people are struggling for life and the future. The overall pace of society is relatively slow. Everyone is very sincere, happy and free.

4. Compared with living in cities, Americans prefer to live in the suburbs. Not only are the environment beautiful and rare, but also the transportation is convenient. Almost every household has a car, and travel is also driving. It is rare to see people walking out.

5. Because of the frequent driving, less walking, eating junk food, and plump beauty, the body of a large part of the United States is not flattering, especially for some elderly women, which is seen in the movie. The male eight-pack abs and the female mermaid vest are completely different.

6. It may be because the US Internet environment is not as developed as the domestic ones. The United States does not have a Chinese low-headed family. It is rare to see people who are playing with mobile phones. People feel that Americans are more concerned with enjoying life than being immersed in some people. Unable to extricate themselves in the virtual world

7. The resources of the United States are unmatched in the country, so most Americans are wasting their national resources unrestrainedly, eating a lot of food, air conditioning has never been turned off, food is a bit too bad, just throw it away. It will definitely not save unnecessary expenses because it saves money.

8. I have only heard of Chinese-style crossings in the past. Now I have seen how Americans cross the road to discover how direct it is: the US regulations are for people, the traffic lights are also for cars, and there is no need to watch traffic lights when crossing the road. .
